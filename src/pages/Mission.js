          <p>The answer to these questions lies in the high-resolution map and motions of stars and gas in the Milky Way, beyond the precision and scope of current astronomical instrumentation.</p>

          <p>The Via Project is using the Milky Way galaxy as a laboratory to answer fundamental questions about the nature of the universe. Via will conduct an all-sky survey of stars using the 6.5-meter MMT (Arizona) and Magellan (Chile) telescopes. The survey will utilize the ViaSpec instruments, which will be built and deployed on each of the telescopes.</p>
          <p>The project is a collaboration between Carnegie Observatories and the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian. Our team includes experts in conducting large-scale surveys and building astronomical instrumentation. We expect to begin the survey in early 2027 to immediately build on the enabling data released by Gaia DR4 and LSST.</p>

          <p>Motions of stars and galaxies indicate that 85% of matter in the universe is invisible. This dark matter is likely a new type of a fundamental particle. However, it has eluded direct detection in our laboratory experiments, so we donâ€™t know if this particle is massive or ultra-light, nor if the particle interacts with either itself or other fundamental particles.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, these different particle physics models can be distinguished by using the Milky Way as a laboratory. Within the Galaxy, models predict very different behavior of dark matter: it could be distributed smoothly, or in thousands of small clumps, or even be a sea of turbulent waves. The Via Project will use dozens of recently discovered stellar streams to precisely map the gravitational pull of dark matter, and ultimately reveal its nature.</p>
